## How we made it

### AI Description

In our project, we employed three AI APIs to generate stories, summaries, and accompanying images based on narrative prompts. Here's a breakdown of our approach:
#### Story Generation
We utilized the OPENAI Assistant API to generate engaging narratives. By assigning the assistant the persona of a renowned sci-fi writer, we ensured immersive storytelling experiences.
#### Summary Generation
Leveraging the capabilities of the OPENAI Chat API, we extracted concise summaries from the generated sci-fi stories. 
#### Image Generation
To complement our stories, we employed the DALLE-3 model to produce visual representations. 

##### Fine-Tuning Examples
###### Step 1 (Original Concept):
Initially, our images reflected a traditional sci-fi aesthetic, which we found to be outdated.

###### Step 2 (Cyberpunk Theme):
Transitioning to a cyberpunk theme introduced visually striking elements, though facial features remained inconsistent and sometimes distorted.

###### Step 3 (Detailed Focus):
Despite efforts to enhance character details, challenges persisted in achieving satisfactory facial rendering.

###### Step 4 (Animated Approach):
Implementing an animated theme proved successful, as it offered greater tolerance for unconventional facial features.

###### Step 5 (Word Removal):
Finally, we refined our images by removing extraneous text, ensuring clarity and focus on visual storytelling.
