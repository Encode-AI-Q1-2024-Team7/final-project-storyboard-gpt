And in turn, Lily shared her dreams and aspirations with Cosmo, inspiring him to see the universe through the eyes of a curious human girl.\n\nEventually, their journey came to an end, but the bond they had formed would last a lifetime. Cosmo and Lily said their farewells, promising to cherish the memories of their adventures together forever.\n\nAnd though they may have been worlds apart, they knew that their friendship would always connect them, bridging the gap between a space-traveling bear and a dream-filled girl from Earth."
